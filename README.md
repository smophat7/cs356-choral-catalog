## Generative AI Usage

### 1. Generate Fake Data

#### My Prompt

I need demo JSON data for a website I'm building. It is for choral sheet music. Here are my TypeScript types/classes that you will match:

```typescript
// type definitions
```

For the coverImageUrl, use "asdf.com" for all.
For the SheetMusicPreview.pageURls, use "page.com" for all.

Generate me 5 songs matching these data structures but in JSON

#### Output

Exactly as expected and as needed.

## Credits

Most data is from JW Pepper (descriptions, score preview images, cover images, etc.) with some supplemental data from generative AI.
